# i18n

This document describes how i18n work in hpapp.

## Translations

We support multiple languages (but mainly Japanese and English) and `assets/translations.json` is a file that contains all language translations. The file represent key value pairs where the key is the English translation and the value is the translation in the target language.

```json
{
  "English content here": {
    "ja": "日本語の翻訳をこちらに書く。"
  },
}
```

Then you can use the translation supported string as follows.

```typescript
import { t } from '@hpapp/i18n';

function MyComponent() {
  return <Text>{t('English content here')}</Text>;
}
```

## Timezone

There is no special support for timezone including daylight saving. `Date` always use the system timezone so if you want to display a date in a specific timezone, you need to convert it manually. 

## Currency

There is no special support for currency. We expect everything is JPY.
