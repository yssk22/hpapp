## Pull Requests

Please follow the best practice below when you make a pull request.

- All pull requests have to be submitted against `develop` branch since the author would validate your change can work in the production environment before merging it to `main` branch. 
- Use [.gittemplate](https://github.com/yssk22/hpapp/blob/main/.gittemplate) for the commit template. ( `git config commit.template ./.gittemplate`)
- Add **ONLY ONE commit** per a pull request. If you need to update your commit during the pull request review, you should still squash your commits into one commit request.
- Use your commit message as your pull request description.
